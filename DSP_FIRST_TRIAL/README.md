- all you have to do is open KEIL and compile this project  
- open target options-> debug-> st-link settings-> trace
- make sure that trace clock have the same clock you use for your microcontroller "in this project I configured it to 100MHz"
- upload the code and open the debugger and add the "input_sample" variable to logic analyzer
